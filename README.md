# Pair Programming Project 🎮

## Project Overview  
This project was developed as part of a **Hackathon** where we had a limited time to come up with a creative and functional solution. In just a couple of hours, we curated and built a fun **Matching Card Game** using an external API that provides inspirational quotes. The objective of the game is to match pairs of inspirational quotes and enjoy a motivating experience!

## 💡 How It Works  
- The game dynamically fetches inspirational quotes from an external API.  
- Players are presented with a grid of six cards, each showing a quote.  
- The goal is to match pairs of quotes by flipping the cards.  
- The game ends once all pairs are matched, and the player can see their performance.
